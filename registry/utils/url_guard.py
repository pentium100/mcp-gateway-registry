"""Hardened URL validation and rebinding-safe fetch guard (SSRF protection).

This module is the single source of truth for validating user- and
registry-controlled URLs before the registry stores them or fetches them
server-side. It consolidates the strengths of the previous partial
implementations (``skill_service._is_safe_url`` and
``ard_net_guard.assert_fetchable``) into one fail-closed guard:

- Only ``http`` / ``https`` schemes are accepted.
- The host must resolve **exclusively** to public IP addresses. IP classification
  lives in this module (the ``coerce_ip_literal`` / ``_ip_denial_reason`` pair,
  the one classifier repo-wide): private, loopback, link-local, reserved,
  multicast, unspecified, and
  CGNAT ranges are blocked, along with the cloud metadata endpoints
  (including AWS endpoints, IPv6 ``fd00:ec2::*``, and Alibaba
  ``100.100.100.200``) which are NEVER reachable —
  not via the coarse bool nor an explicit CIDR allowlist.
- Obfuscated IPv4 literals (hex/octal/decimal/trailing-dot) and embedded-IPv4 IPv6
  transports (mapped ``::ffff:``, NAT64, 6to4, Teredo) are recognized and
  category-checked, so a private/metadata target cannot be smuggled through a
  non-canonical spelling.
- Explicit host/CIDR allowlists can admit private, loopback, and CGNAT targets,
  but cloud/workload credential endpoints, link-local, unspecified, reserved, and
  multicast destinations remain hard-denied.
- Hostname trust (``ssrf_allowed_hosts`` / ``github_extra_hosts``) is a
  post-resolution relaxation, not a DNS bypass. Trusted names are still resolved,
  every answer is classified, and the request is pinned to a validated answer.
  Explicit hostname trust can admit non-credential private/internal addresses,
  but EC2/ECS/EKS credential endpoints remain hard-denied before that relaxation.
- The bundled ``mcpgw-server`` name is reserved and is not in ``PROXY_PROFILE``'s
  global hostname set. A dedicated profile is selected only for the exact built-in
  MCP entity ``/airegistry-tools/`` with target ``http://mcpgw-server:8003/``.
- DNS-rebinding is defeated by pinning: the fetch connects only to an IP that
  was validated inside the same transport call, so there is no window between
  the check and the connect for the hostname to rebind to a private address.
  Redirects are re-validated on every hop because httpx re-invokes the pinned
  transport for each redirect.

The guard fails closed: any error, resolution failure, or ambiguity results in
rejection rather than a permissive fallback.

Validation profiles separate the registry's distinct outbound trust surfaces:

- **Skill fetches** (``SKILL_PROFILE``): public-only, with an operator bypass
  allowlist read from ``settings.github_extra_hosts`` so GitHub Enterprise
  Server on an internal network stays reachable. Built-in public forge domains
  are NOT auto-trusted — they get full IP validation, closing the
  "internal host masquerading as github.com" bypass.

- **Server / agent targets** (``PROXY_PROFILE``): the same public-only default,
  but operators who legitimately proxy to internal MCP servers can opt those
  targets in via ``settings.ssrf_allowed_hosts`` / ``settings.ssrf_allowed_cidrs``.
  Cloud/workload credential endpoints are never allowlistable in any profile.

- **Credential-bearing OAuth token endpoints**
  (``CREDENTIALED_OAUTH_PROFILE``): HTTPS-only, and public-only unless the
  operator names a trusted IdP host in ``settings.egress_oauth_trusted_idp_hosts``
  (hosts only — no CIDRs, no wildcards — and empty by default). Token POSTs carry
  client secrets, refresh tokens, or user assertions, so this profile must never
  inherit the proxy profile's internal-target bypass: it reads only its own
  setting, and an ``ssrf_allowed_hosts``/``github_extra_hosts`` entry cannot
  re-permit a token endpoint.

                                           at the SECOND hop before any connect.

    Fail closed everywhere: any resolution failure, un-encodable host, identity
