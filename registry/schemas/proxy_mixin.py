"""Shared gateway-proxy opt-in for registry entities + the SSRF egress guard.

Any entity type (MCP server, A2A agent, skill, virtual server, custom entity)
can opt into being served through the gateway by setting ``is_proxied=True``.
The registry then generates an nginx location block that routes authenticated
traffic to the entity's effective backend URL.

Security posture (this module wires the entity/proxy layer to the SSRF control):
- IP classification + the egress allowlist are owned by the canonical
  ``registry.utils.url_guard``, including its inline literal parser and IP-category
  classifier. The functions here are thin PROXY_PROFILE adapters that translate the guard's ``UrlValidationError`` into the local
  ``EgressPolicyError`` (a ``ValueError``) so a Pydantic field validator surfaces a
  clean 4xx. Registration and the fetch-time pinned transport therefore share ONE
  policy — the ``gateway_proxy_allow_private_targets`` bool (relaxes loopback/
  private/CGNAT only) plus ``ssrf_allowed_hosts``/``ssrf_allowed_cidrs`` (an explicit
  CIDR re-permits any non-metadata category); the cloud metadata endpoints
  (169.254.169.254 AND the IPv6 fd00:ec2::254) are NEVER reachable.
- The static check is best-effort on literal-IP targets; hostnames pass it (no DNS
  in a validator). The authoritative rebind defense is the fetch-time pinned
  transport (``url_guard.guarded_async_client``, which resolves+validates+connects
  inside the transport call for every request and redirect hop) plus the network
  egress policy — not this static edge check.
- The guard runs at three points (model validator, service resolve-and-pin, nginx
  render) so a row written before the policy existed, or by a federation sync that
  bypasses the Pydantic validator, still cannot emit a live route to a denied host.

Two application-layer checks, by context:
- ``_assert_egress_allowed`` / ``egress_guard_validator`` — the STATIC (literal-IP)
  check at the Pydantic API edge (422), via ``url_guard.validate_url(resolve=False)``.
- ``resolve_and_validate_proxy_target`` / ``validate_and_pin_proxy_target`` — the
  DNS-aware check (layer 2), run at the service register/update layer and by
  the scheduled pin-refresh, via ``url_guard.validate_url(resolve=True)``. Resolves
  the hostname, validates every resolved IP, and returns them for pin bookkeeping.
